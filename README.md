Explorations in mathematical formulae

A collection of programs working to visualize mathematical formulae.
Emphasis on visualization and precision is trying to be kept.
Most of these programs are basic and will be improved with need.


Program             Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fib.py              This program uses what is know as the Binnet formula to
                    calculate the value of the nth Fibonacci number. N is able
                    to be entered as a positive or real number if we allow for
                    complex results. This program graphs N on the z axis and
                    the complex number on the xy plane with x the real axis and
                    y the imaginary axis.  Two sub graphs plot
                    Imaginary vs. Real and Real vs. N.
